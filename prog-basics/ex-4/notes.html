    <h1>Documentation: Debugging with Debug Package</h1>

    <h2>Level 1</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>The objective of this level was to install the <code>debug</code> package and set up a namespace for debugging within a single module. I used the <code>debug</code> function to log messages selectively based on the <code>DEBUG</code> environment variable. This approach allows developers to enable or disable debugging messages without modifying the code. The implementation was straightforward and worked as expected.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>No challenges were faced during this level.</p>
    <h3>LLM Usage</h3>
    <p>No language model was used to complete this level, as I have a strong understanding of JavaScript and the debug package.</p>

    <h2>Level 2</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>In this level, I extended the program to include multiple modules, each with its own debug namespace. The goal was to use environment variables to selectively enable debugging for specific modules. This involved defining unique namespaces for each module and testing the <code>DEBUG</code> environment variable to verify selective debugging. The setup was clear and functional, making it easy to debug individual parts of the program.</p>

    <h2>Level 3</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>The focus of this level was to combine the <code>debug</code> package with <code>winston</code> for structured debugging and logging in a complex program scenario. I enhanced the compute program by making it interactive, integrating both tools to provide selective debugging and detailed logging. The <code>debug</code> package was used for on-demand debugging, while <code>winston</code> handled structured logs for critical events. The two tools complemented each other effectively, providing a robust debugging and logging solution.</p>
