    <h2>Level 1</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>In this level, I focused on setting up a basic Node.js project with the essential start and dev scripts. Since I have a solid foundation in JavaScript, this task was fairly straightforward. The goal was to create a simple structure for running the application and debugging it in development mode. Everything worked smoothly, and I didn't encounter any issues along the way.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>No challenges were faced during this level.</p>
    <h3>LLM Usage</h3>
    <p>No language model was used to complete this task, as I have a strong understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.</p>

    <h2>Level 2</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>This level involved adding the <code>chalk</code> package for styling the console outputs and configuring <code>nodemon</code> for automatic restarts during development. Both of these tools are widely used and easy to integrate into a Node.js project. I used <code>chalk</code> to add some color to the console messages, which was a simple but effective improvement. The <code>nodemon</code> setup was also straightforward, and I appreciated how it automatically restarted the app whenever changes were made. Given my background in JavaScript, I didn't face any significant challenges here and was able to get everything running smoothly.</p>

    <h2>Level 3</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>In this level, I added a <code>prestart</code> script to ensure the <code>node_modules</code> directory was available before starting the application. This was a practical step to make sure the app would function even if the dependencies were removed. The process involved writing a simple check and reinstalling the dependencies if necessary. I tested the solution by removing the <code>node_modules</code> directory, and everything worked as expected without any issues.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>These tasks were a great exercise in setting up and managing a Node.js project. With my strong foundation in JavaScript, I was able to complete each step smoothly. No challenges were encountered, and no language model assistance was needed to complete the tasks. The experience reinforced best practices for managing dependencies, running applications, and using tools like <code>chalk</code> and <code>nodemon</code> in a development environment.</p>
