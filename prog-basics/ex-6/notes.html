    <h2>LLM Used for this project<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67625b89-e560-8013-8937-2d984c66c08f">here is the link</a> </h2>

    <h2>Level 1</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>The objective of this level was to install the <code>config</code> library and create a <code>default.yaml</code> file to manage configurations. I focused on reading values from the YAML file and using them in the program. As I was new to YAML, I researched its structure and syntax to create the configuration file correctly. Using the <code>config</code> library to load these values into the program was straightforward and worked as expected.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>The main challenge was my unfamiliarity with YAML syntax. This required additional effort to understand its conventions and structure.</p>
    <h3>LLM Usage</h3>
    <p>Yes, I used an LLM to learn YAML syntax and structure. The AI helped me understand the format and provided examples, which were instrumental in completing this level.</p>

    <h2>Level 2</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>At this level, I extended the configuration to support multiple environments such as <code>development</code> and <code>production</code>. This involved creating separate YAML files for each environment and configuring the program to load the appropriate file based on the current environment variable. This approach makes it easy to manage environment-specific settings and switch between them dynamically.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>No significant challenges were faced during this level, as my understanding of YAML improved from the previous level.</p>
    <h3>LLM Usage</h3>
    <p>Yes, I used an LLM to clarify the setup for environment-specific configurations. The AI provided insights on best practices for managing multiple environments.</p>

    <h2>Level 3</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>The focus of this level was to use the configuration file to dynamically adjust program behavior and extend functionality without modifying existing code. I used the YAML file to define logging levels and specify additional commands, along with their respective functions and files. The program dynamically loaded these functions, such as <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code>, from a specified file. This approach allows for highly flexible and modular code, enabling new features to be added simply by updating the configuration file.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>The challenge was implementing dynamic functionality based on the configuration. This required careful structuring of the YAML file and ensuring the program could parse and execute the specified commands correctly.</p>
    <h3>LLM Usage</h3>
    <p>Yes, I used an LLM to understand how to dynamically load functions specified in a YAML configuration. The AI provided examples and clarified concepts, which greatly aided in completing this level.</p>
