    <h2>Level 1</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>The objective of this level was to install the <code>dotenv</code> library and use it to load configuration variables from a <code>.env</code> file. The variables, such as <code>PORT</code> and <code>DB_HOST</code>, were created in the <code>.env</code> file and loaded into the program using <code>dotenv.config()</code>. The process of reading and using these values for program configuration was straightforward, given my prior experience with environment variables in training projects.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>No challenges were faced during this level.</p>
    <h3>LLM Usage</h3>
    <p>No language model was used to complete this level, as I have experience with <code>dotenv</code> from previous projects.</p>

    <h2>Level 2</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>In this level, I enhanced the program to include fallback values for missing environment variables. Additionally, I added functionality to log warnings when a variable was missing. This ensures the program handles missing variables gracefully without failing. Implementing these features involved checking for undefined variables and providing defaults where necessary, which was straightforward due to my familiarity with handling environment variables.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>No challenges were faced during this level.</p>
    <h3>LLM Usage</h3>
    <p>No language model was used to complete this level, as I have experience with environment variables and error handling.</p>

    <h2>Level 3</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>The focus of this level was to use environment variables to configure a database connection and API credentials. For this exercise, I used a SQLite file-based database. I ensured that sensitive configuration details were logged securely, avoiding exposure of critical information such as API keys. Implementing secure logging and configuring the database connection was straightforward due to my existing knowledge and prior experience with similar setups.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>No challenges were faced during this level.</p>
    <h3>LLM Usage</h3>
    <p>No language model was used to complete this level, as I have a strong understanding of environment variable management and secure programming practices.</p>
