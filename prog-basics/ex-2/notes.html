    <h2>Level 1</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>The goal at this level was to create a basic script that calculates the sum of numbers passed as command-line arguments. I used <code>process.argv</code> to access the arguments, parsed them into numbers, and added error handling to manage invalid inputs like non-numeric values. With my solid understanding of JavaScript, implementing these features was straightforward. Error handling was implemented using simple checks to ensure all inputs were valid numbers.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>No challenges were faced during this level.</p>
    <h3>LLM Usage</h3>
    <p>No language model was used to complete this task, as I have a strong understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.</p>

    <h2>Level 2</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>At this level, I enhanced the script to include a <code>--multiply</code> flag for multiplying the input numbers instead of adding them. Additionally, I added usage instructions to the script to make it user-friendly. Parsing the <code>--multiply</code> flag involved checking for its presence in the arguments and adjusting the logic accordingly. Updating the help text was a simple matter of formatting a clear and concise usage guide. The implementation was smooth due to my familiarity with handling command-line arguments in Node.js.</p>

    <h2>Level 3</h2>
    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>In this level, I modularized the program by creating a separate file, <code>mathutils.js</code>, to handle the addition and multiplication logic. This made the program more maintainable and reusable. I then updated the script to take the operation (<code>add</code> or <code>multiply</code>) followed by operands as command-line arguments. For example, the command <code>add 1 2</code> or <code>multiply 3 4</code>. Lastly, I configured the script to be used as a global command by setting up the <code>bin</code> property in <code>package.json</code> and using <code>npm link</code> to test it. Given my understanding of Node.js modules and npm, this was straightforward and worked as expected.</p>
