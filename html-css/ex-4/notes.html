        <h1>Notes on Advanced Responsive Design</h1>

        <h2>Flexible Grid System</h2>
        <p>Using Flexbox for creating flexible grids allows for a highly adaptable layout. By using properties like <code>flex-wrap</code>, we ensure that the items adjust and wrap based on the screen size. This eliminates the need for specific breakpoints and makes the design more fluid.</p>

        <h2>Fluid Typography</h2>
        <p>Fluid typography using <code>clamp()</code> allows us to set a range of font sizes that scale dynamically with the viewport size. This helps ensure the text remains readable on all devices. The minimum, preferred, and maximum values for font size ensure it never becomes too small or too large, maintaining readability.</p>

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring that all elements scale fluidly while maintaining a consistent design.</li>
            <li>Testing across different devices and screen sizes to ensure the layout and typography are responsive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>By combining Flexbox and fluid typography techniques like <code>clamp()</code>, we can create a fully responsive, scalable layout that adapts to different screen sizes without the need for complex media queries.</p>
