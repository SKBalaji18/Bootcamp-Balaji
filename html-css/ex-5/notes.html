    <h1>CSS Grid Layout Notes</h1>

    <p>The layout for this design uses CSS Grid to create a flexible structure with specific areas for a header, two sidebars, main content, and a footer. The key techniques used are:</p>
    
    <h2>Key Techniques:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grid Template Areas:</strong> Used to define distinct regions such as "header", "sidebar-left", "main", etc.</li>
        <li><strong>minmax():</strong> This function is used in the grid columns to allow flexible sizing, ensuring columns can shrink and expand between a minimum and maximum width.</li>
        <li><strong>Media Queries:</strong> These allow us to modify the layout for smaller screens. On mobile, the layout is stacked vertically for better readability and usability.</li>
        <li><strong>Overflow Handling:</strong> In the main content area, content that exceeds the available height is allowed to overflow with a scrollbar, using `overflow: auto`.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mobile Layout Adjustments:</h2>
    <p>The layout is adjusted using a media query for screens smaller than 768px wide. In these cases, the grid switches to a single-column layout with the sidebar and main content stacked vertically. The sidebars are placed after the main content.</p>
