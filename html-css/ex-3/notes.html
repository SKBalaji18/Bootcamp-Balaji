        <h1>Notes on Classless CSS</h1>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Working without classes or IDs was an interesting challenge. It encourages minimalism and makes the HTML simpler, as you don't need to assign classes or IDs to every element. Instead, we rely on element selectors to apply styles globally to basic HTML tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, etc.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited styling control: You can't customize specific instances of elements without introducing more CSS rules or classes.</li>
            <li>Harder to achieve highly complex layouts or designs without relying on custom classes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Classless CSS Frameworks</h2>
        <p>I experimented with classless CSS frameworks like <a href="https://classless.de">classless.de</a>, which automatically provides styling to common HTML elements. This approach saves time and keeps things simple, but can be limiting for highly customized designs.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Classless CSS is a great way to create simple, clean designs quickly, but may not be ideal for complex, custom layouts. It is perfect for blogs, articles, and minimalistic websites.</p>
