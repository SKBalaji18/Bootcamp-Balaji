        <h1>Color Selection and Variations - Exercise Notes</h1>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The goal was to create an interactive page where users can select one or more colors and see how they appear on a sample page. The page includes headers, text, tables, images, etc., and the selected color scheme is applied to these elements. Variations of the selected color, such as changes in saturation, lightness, and opacity, are also displayed for comparison.</p>
        <p>User interaction is facilitated through UI elements like color pickers, sliders, and input fields, allowing users to adjust not only the primary color but also its variations. The changes are reflected live on the sample page, so users can immediately see how their choices affect the layout and design.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Challenges included deciding how to best represent color variations and how to allow the user to interact intuitively with the system. Providing enough control over color properties like saturation, lightness, and opacity without overwhelming the user was also a key consideration.</p>

        <h2>LLM Used</h2>
        <p>No LLM used.</p>
