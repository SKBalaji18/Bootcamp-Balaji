        <h1>Using Tools - Exercise Notes</h1>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The exercise involved setting up a TypeScript project with a package manager (npm) and configuring it using a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file. The project focused on solving three problems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Problem 1: Load a JSON file, render a table dynamically, and include sorting functionality.</li>
            <li>Problem 2: Fetch data from a CSV file using PapaParse, enhance the table with column filtering and row highlighting.</li>
            <li>Problem 3: Integrate a build tool (e.g., tsc for transpilation) and package the project for both development and production environments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vite was used for the development server, live reload, linting, and production build bundling.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I encountered many errors as I am new to TypeScript and Vite. To resolve these, I referred to documentation on StackOverflow and official pages to understand and fix the issues.</p>

        <h2>LLM Used</h2>
        <p>Yes, LLM was used.</p>
