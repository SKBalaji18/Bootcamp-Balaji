        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>This exercise focused on using Vite to its full potential, implementing advanced features and best practices. The first task involved setting up environment-specific configurations by creating <code>.env.development</code> and <code>.env.production</code> files to define separate API endpoints for development and production environments. The app fetches data from the appropriate endpoint based on the environment.</p>
        <p>Advanced Vite practices were applied by integrating <code>vite-plugin-checker</code> for real-time TypeScript type-checking and <code>vite-plugin-eslint</code> for linting during development. Errors are displayed during the build process.</p>
        <p>The final task involved building upon the previous work from Exercise 3 (TypeScript version) by adding advanced features like lazy loading, code splitting, and production optimizations such as minification and tree-shaking. Performance testing was also conducted on the final build.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I faced many errors related to ESLint and TypeScript configuration. Eventually, I used an LLM to resolve these issues.</p>

        <h2>LLM Used</h2>
        <p>Yes, LLM was used.</p>
