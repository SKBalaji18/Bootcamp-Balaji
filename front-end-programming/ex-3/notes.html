        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The exercise involved using Vite to scaffold, configure, and build projects with modern tools. The first task was to initialize a Vite project using the JavaScript template, then rebuild the student management dashboard from Exercise 1. The second task was to enhance the dashboard using the TypeScript template, fetching data from a CSV file, parsing it with PapaParse, and displaying it with AG Grid. The code was modularized for data loading, parsing, and rendering.</p>
        <p>The final part involved defining CSS classes with specific margin sizes, and using SCSS with loops for the same purpose. Viteâ€™s support for SCSS was explored during this step.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>There were not many challenges as previous experience helped with setting up Vite. However, I faced some confusion when implementing AG Grid within Vite.</p>

        <h2>LLM Used</h2>
        <p>Yes, LLM was used.</p>
