        <h2>Level 1: Recreating a Simple Webpage Layout</h2>
        <p>For Level 1, I recreated the layout of a simple webpage, such as a Medium article. This involved ensuring consistent margins and padding across sections to achieve a polished and balanced look. White space was used strategically to create clear separation between sections, enhancing readability and reducing visual clutter.</p>
        <p>Aligning text and images correctly was a key focus, as improper alignment can make the layout feel disorganized. The challenge was maintaining consistency in spacing while adapting the layout to different screen sizes.</p>

        <h2>Level 2: Visual Hierarchy and Grid Layout</h2>
        <p>In Level 2, I designed a layout emphasizing visual hierarchy. A homepage was created with a large hero section to grab attention, followed by a featured article grid and a footer. Larger fonts and bolder colors were applied to important elements to ensure they stood out and guided the viewerâ€™s focus.</p>
        <p>Gutters were added between sections to maintain visual clarity, preventing the design from feeling crowded. I used a CSS grid system to organize content effectively, making it easier to manage spacing and alignment.</p>
        <p>The challenges included finding the right balance between bold elements and maintaining overall harmony. Implementing the grid system required careful planning to ensure that all sections were visually aligned and responsive.</p>
