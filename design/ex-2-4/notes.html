        <h2>Level 1: Adding and Styling Images</h2>
        <p>For Level 1, I added three images to the web page using a placeholder image service (e.g., Lorem Picsum). CSS was applied to set the width, height, and border-radius of the images, giving them a uniform appearance while maintaining flexibility for different designs.</p>
        <p>The main challenge was selecting appropriate placeholder images that fit the intended layout and ensuring the styles were responsive across devices.</p>

        <h2>Level 2: Image Editing and Overlays</h2>
        <p>In Level 2, I edited an image to adjust its size and compression, ensuring faster load times without compromising quality. A full-bleed image was added as a page header, styled using CSS to cover the entire width of the page and create a striking visual impact.</p>
        <p>CSS overlays, such as gradients and color tints, were applied to the header image to enhance text readability and aesthetic appeal. Balancing the overlay opacity and ensuring proper contrast posed a minor challenge, especially when viewed on different devices.</p>

        <h2>Level 3: Responsive and Optimized Images</h2>
        <p>For Level 3, I implemented responsive images using the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element, which allowed the browser to load appropriate image sizes based on the viewport. This approach ensured optimal performance and clarity on devices with varying screen resolutions.</p>
        <p>I created an image with high-resolution and low-resolution versions, dynamically displayed depending on the user’s device. Lazy loading techniques were also employed to defer the loading of images until they were in the viewport, reducing initial page load times.</p>
        <p>The primary challenges included ensuring seamless transitions between image resolutions and verifying that lazy loading didn’t affect user experience negatively on slower networks.</p>
