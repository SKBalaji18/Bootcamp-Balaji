        <h2>Level 1: Monochromatic, Complementary, and Three-Color Schemes</h2>
        <p>In Level 1, I began by designing a card with a monochromatic theme using a base color. The goal was to differentiate the card's background, border, and shadow while maintaining a cohesive look. The alpha channel adjustments were crucial for subtle contrast, ensuring the design didn’t feel overly harsh.</p>
        <p>The second task involved creating a complementary color scheme. This required careful attention to contrast, particularly between text and backgrounds, to maintain readability. Implementing a three-color scheme with an accent color added a layer of complexity, as I needed to decide where to apply the accent for maximum effect. Buttons, links, and headers became natural choices for accentuation.</p>
        <p>Challenges included balancing contrast and harmony in the complementary scheme and ensuring the accent color didn’t overpower the design.</p>

        <h2>Level 2: Dark and Light Themes, Color Swatches, and Image Overlays</h2>
        <p>For Level 2, I defined CSS variables (--primary, --secondary, and --background) to create both dark and light themes. This made switching themes seamless and helped in maintaining consistency across elements. Styling an image with overlaid text presented another challenge, as I had to ensure sufficient contrast between the overlay and the image in both themes.</p>
        <p>Building a color swatch page allowed me to explore HSL values in-depth. Generating variations in saturation and lightness provided insights into how subtle adjustments impact visual appeal. Labeling each swatch with its HSL value was a simple but effective way to document the exercise.</p>
        <p>The main challenges included optimizing the swatch layout for different screen sizes and achieving a good contrast balance in the image overlays.</p>

        <h2>Level 3: Gradient Themes, Responsive Palettes, and Accessibility</h2>
        <p>For the advanced tasks in Level 3, I designed gradient themes using CSS. Linear gradients were applied to headers, and radial gradients added a dynamic feel to buttons. Experimenting with gradient angles and stops helped showcase the versatility of this approach.</p>
        <p>Creating a responsive color palette required defining tints and shades for the base colors. Using CSS functions like lighten() and darken() allowed for dynamic adjustments, which were applied through media queries for various breakpoints.</p>
        <p>An accessibility-focused contrast demonstration page was an essential addition. It highlighted how different color combinations meet accessibility standards and emphasized the importance of borders and shadows for establishing a visual hierarchy. This task underscored the challenge of balancing aesthetics with functional design.</p>
