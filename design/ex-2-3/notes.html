    <h1>Icon Experiment Notes</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Level 1: Using an Icon Font Library</h2>
        <p>For Level 1, I added three icons to the page using an icon font library (e.g., Font Awesome). Each icon was styled individually with CSS to adjust size, color, and spacing. This allowed for a consistent and visually appealing layout while exploring basic customization options.</p>
        <p>The challenge at this stage was ensuring that the font library loaded correctly and that the icons scaled well across different screen sizes without losing clarity.</p>

        <h2>Level 2: SVG Icons and Interactive Effects</h2>
        <p>In Level 2, I replaced one of the font-based icons with an inline SVG file. This switch allowed for greater flexibility in styling and resolution independence. I then created a grid of six icons: three from the font library and three as inline SVGs. Adding hover effects such as color changes and scaling enhanced the interactivity and visual feedback.</p>
        <p>The main challenge was balancing the styling of the SVG and font icons to ensure they appeared cohesive within the same grid. Additionally, hover effects needed to be subtle yet noticeable to maintain a professional design.</p>

        <h2>Level 3: Navigation Bar and Advanced Icon Usage</h2>
        <p>For Level 3, I designed a navigation bar with icons as the main interactive elements. The bar included home, about, and contact icons, each aligned with a label using CSS. Ensuring proper alignment and spacing between icons and labels was critical for achieving a clean and user-friendly layout.</p>
        <p>I also created buttons for download and upload actions, embedding SVG icons directly into the button design. Consistent spacing and alignment across all icons on the page were maintained using CSS flexbox and grid techniques.</p>
        <p>The challenge here was creating a unified style for both navigation and action buttons while ensuring the design remained responsive across different devices.</p>
