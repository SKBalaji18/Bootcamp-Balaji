        <h2>Level 1: System Fonts and Basic Styling</h2>
        <p>For Level 1, I used system fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier to demonstrate basic font styling. Each font was assigned a different weight to highlight how weight affects typography. The main challenge here was ensuring cross-browser compatibility for the system fonts, as some fonts render slightly differently on various platforms.</p>
        <p>Additionally, embedding a small JavaScript snippet into the HTML helped to verify the pageâ€™s functionality. Keeping the script concise and functional within ten lines was straightforward.</p>

        <h2>Level 2: Google Fonts and Variable Fonts</h2>
        <p>In this level, I integrated Google Fonts such as Roboto, Merriweather, and Fira Code to represent sans-serif, serif, and monospace fonts respectively. These fonts were chosen for their readability and aesthetic contrast. Applying variable fonts was an exciting step, allowing dynamic adjustments to font weight using CSS properties. This feature enabled me to demonstrate a flexible and modern approach to typography.</p>
        <p>The challenge here was understanding and utilizing the @import syntax for Google Fonts while maintaining page performance. I also explored text effects like drop caps, shadows, and image-filled text. Each effect required careful layering and styling to ensure consistent visual appeal across screen sizes.</p>

        <h2>Level 3: Custom Fonts and Advanced Typography</h2>
        <p>For Level 3, I installed the Geist font locally and applied it to a specific section of the page. Combining custom fonts with Google Fonts helped create a clear typographic hierarchy, distinguishing headers from body text. The Geist font added a unique character to the design, while Roboto and Merriweather ensured readability.</p>
        <p>Adjusting font size, letter spacing, and line height was crucial to enhance readability and achieve a balanced layout. The main challenge was managing multiple font files and ensuring they loaded efficiently, particularly for locally hosted fonts. I had to optimize the web page to avoid delays in rendering text.</p>
