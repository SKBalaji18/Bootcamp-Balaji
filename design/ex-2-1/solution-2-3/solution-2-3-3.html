                <h1>Typography</h1>
                <h2>What is Typography?</h2>
                <p>
                    Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The choice of fonts, spacing, and layout plays a vital role in how content is perceived by readers.
                </p>

                <h2>Why is Typography Important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Typography helps establish a visual hierarchy, guiding the reader through content in a structured and logical manner. It improves readability and ensures that your message is effectively conveyed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, using a <span class="highlight">bold and striking font</span> for headers helps them stand out, while a clean and simple font for body text ensures easy reading. Proper spacing, such as line height and margins, also enhances the overall user experience.
                </p>

                <h2>Typography in Web Design</h2>
                <p>
                    In web design, typography is more than just choosing fonts. It involves managing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Font sizes and weights</li>
                    <li>Line height and letter spacing</li>
                    <li>Text alignment and color contrast</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By combining fonts like <span class="highlight">Montserrat</span> for headers and <span class="highlight">Roboto</span> for body text, you can create a professional and visually appealing design.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                    When designing with typography:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use font pairings that complement each other.</li>
                    <li>Maintain consistent spacing and alignment.</li>
                    <li>Ensure adequate contrast between text and background.</li>
                </ol>
