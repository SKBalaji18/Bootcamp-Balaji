        <h1>Static Site Generation - Exercise Notes</h1>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The task was to design and prototype a static version of an e-commerce website like Amazon or Flipkart. The solution involved static site generation, ensuring scalability and hosting viability on platforms like Netlify or Cloudflare. The catalog data was retrieved from a `data.json` file, which was used to display the items without the need for server-side processing.</p>
        <p>The project included implementing client-side search with features. Category filtering was also added to improve usability. Optimization techniques were explored to manage large catalogs while considering browser limitations.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Challenges included implementing auto-suggestions in the search functionality and refining category filtering for better user experience.</p>

        <h2>LLM Used</h2>
        <p>Yes, LLM was used.</p>
