            Navigation hierarchy is a bit confusing, and after navigating to some points, it becomes unclear where the user is. If we want to navigate back to the homepage, it feels complex.

        <div>
            <b>Exercise 1:</b><br>
            <span>Rating: 7.5/10</span>
            The fonts are achieved well, and the functional design is impressive. However, it’s quite confusing in terms of where we are within the design. Additionally, reducing the line height of the paragraph elements could improve readability.
        </div>

        <div>
            <b>Exercise 2:</b><br>
            <span>Rating: 8/10</span>
            The style and layout are neat and simple, but the monochromatic theme is missing. I was really impressed with the linear gradient version. The styling was nice and well done.

        <div>
            <b>Exercise 3:</b><br>

            <span>Rating: 6/10</span>
            The color task was achieved. However, removing the style from the first exercise would result in a more structured layout and eliminate confusion. The text passage can be shortened, and dark/light theme toggling is missing. More focus should be placed on the linear gradient.

        <div>
            <b>Exercise 3:</b><br>
            <span>Rating: 5/10</span>

            In the 1st solution, the image could be removed as it occupies unnecessary space and lengthens the page. A monochromatic theme could have been better. In the 2nd solution, I think Rohan got confused while placing a section card. There is a lack of layout structuring. However, the color implementation is good. Different sections of the solution are placed inappropriately.

            More effort is needed to refine the monochromatic and complementary color themes. The layout design and linear gradient implementations also need significant improvement.

            There is a clear understanding of the color palette in the monochromatic style, and the layout is good. However, changing darker colors for the text would improve visual appeal. The implementation of dark and light theme switches is great, but the color swatch is too static.
