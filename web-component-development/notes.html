        <h1>Web Components - Weather Widget Exercise Notes</h1>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The task was to create a weather widget using Web Components. The widget is a custom HTML element <code>&lt;city-weather&gt;</code> that displays the weather for a given city. By default, it shows the weather for Los Angeles. A form was implemented to allow users to enter a city name, which updates the city attribute of the widget dynamically. The widget logic was encapsulated in a separate JavaScript module.</p>
        <p>The project included creating two sample pages that use the widget, showcasing the flexibility and reusability of Web Components. An API from Open Meteo was used to fetch weather data for cities.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>No challenges were faced, as I had prior experience with a similar project.</p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>The weather data was retrieved using the Open Meteo API.</p>

        <h2>LLM Used</h2>
        <p>Yes, LLM was used.</p>
