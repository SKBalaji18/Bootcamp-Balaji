        <h1>Research Papers Filtering - Exercise Notes</h1>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The task was to build a UI for filtering research papers. The application retrieves 1,000 papers from a JSON file and displays them as a list of cards. Features include a filter widget for criteria like year, a search bar for filtering title, author, and a range for numerical filters. The filtered data can also be exported as a zip file.</p>
        <p>Filters are dynamically generated based on data retrieved from the backend(JSON file). Efficient strategies are used for handling fields with numerous options, such as a search filter for title. The interface provides pagination for better user experience, and sorting options allow users to arrange papers by criteria like year.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I faced significant challenges in obtaining the JSON data. Aftre some time, I sourced a CSV file from Kaggle, which I then converted to JSON using an online CSV-to-JSON converter.</p>

        <h2>LLM Used</h2>
        <p>Yes, LLM was used.</p>
