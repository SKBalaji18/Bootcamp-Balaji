        <h1>City Weather App - React.js Exercise Notes</h1>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>In this exercise, I reworked the city weather application that was originally built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and rebuilt it using React.js. I used Tailwind CSS for styling to enhance the UI. The app fetches weather data based on the city name and displays it in a clean and user-friendly interface.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>As I am new to Tailwind CSS, I faced some difficulty with its utility-first classes and encountered several errors. However, I was able to resolve these issues efficiently through practice and troubleshooting.</p>

        <h2>LLM Used</h2>
        <p>No, LLM was not used.</p>
