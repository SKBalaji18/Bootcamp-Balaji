        <h1>Research Paper Filter - React.js Exercise Notes</h1>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>In this exercise, I reworked the research paper filtering application that was originally built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and rebuilt it using React.js. The application used a `data.csv` file containing 1,000 research paper records as the data source. The task was to implement the filtering functionality in React.js while ensuring the display of the research papers and their attributes.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>No challenges were faced during this task.</p>

        <h2>LLM Used</h2>
        <p>No, LLM was not used.</p>
